/* 
  Given an unsorted non-empty array of integers and int k, return the k most frequent elements (in any order)

  Explanation: 3 is the only value that would be passed in for k because it is the only value for k that has
  a valid solution. Since 1, 2, and 3, all occur 3 times, they are all the most frequent ints, so there is no
  1 most frequent int, or 2 most frequent int, but there are 3 most frequent ints.
